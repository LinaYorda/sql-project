A company whose catalogs consist of tech products is exploring expansion into the Brazilian market. The initial research shows Brazil has a booming eCommerce market with revenue similar to Spain's. 

Because of a lack of knowledge, the company decided to use a local SaaS business with a centralized management system connecting small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces. 

## Data Source 

The data for this analysis consists of 8 tables with different information obtained from the Brazilian SaaS company. Information regarding products, suppliers, customers, product reviews, and payment is available. 

## Objective

Data analysis is used to evaluate and help the company decide if a future collaboration on the Brazilian market would be beneficial. Various SQL queries are applied. 

## Folder Structure 

* /src: contains the two SQL scripts.
* /data: exported data from MySQL Workbench.
* /docs: project presentation.

## Summary of findings

An initial market analysis shows a demand for the type of products the Spanish company offers. In addition, the eCommerce market's growth in Brazil has been significant since 2014. 


However, the research revealed that a future collaboration between both businesses would not benefit the European company for various reasons:

1. The customer satisfaction level is acceptable, but partnering with Magist to launch in Brazil is not recommended.

2. Another concern is the low sales rate of technological products compared to the entire e-commerce platform. 

3. Long delivery timings could potentially harm the image of the Eniac brand and lead to negative reviews.
